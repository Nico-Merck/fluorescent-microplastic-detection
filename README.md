This is the code and data space to the paper on "Non-contact detection of fluorescent microplastic particles in water flow using spectrometry". 

This study demonstrates in-flow detection of polypropylene particles containing production-added fluorescent dyes: fluorescence spectroscopy enabled classification via intensity ratios and clustering, while interferometric particle imaging revealed particle size and type.
